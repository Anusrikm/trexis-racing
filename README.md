# Trexis Racing

Welcome to the Trexis Racing Team Trials where you'll be tested on your development skills.  We have brought you on board today because you specialize in a particular skill that we believe will not only benefit us a as a team, but you as a developer.  Trexis Racing prides itself as being one of the top competitors in many racing series including Formula 1 and the World Endurance Championship.  Competing in multiple categories requires many personnel and we are having trouble keeping track of the roster of each team.  We have already began to construct a mini-application which currently only retrieves members of the organization.  This is where you come in.  Trexis Racing needs you to add a feature to this application that allows us to add new members to our organization, and most importantly to a specific team.  You have been provided the application source code and your job is to create this feature.  Trexis Racing looks forward to seeing what you can accomplish!  Good luck!

## Requirements

As a user, I need to be able to add a member to the organization so that I can keep track of each team roster.

Member properties

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Job Title
4. Status
5. Team

### Acceptance Criteria
* **Angular unit tests should pass with code coverage of at least 80% on all files **
* On the member summary page (List of the members), I should be able to navigate to and from the member detail page
* The member detail form should include fields for each of the member properties
* Saving the member should redirect me back to the member summary page where I should see the new member listed on the table
* Each member should be updatable
* Each member should be removable



### BONUS Acceptance Criteria 
* I should not be able to navigate to members page without being logged on
* The member detail form should have client-side validation
* The member detail form should have server-side validation

_Remember this simulates a mini "Full-Stack" web application so be sure to develop for both server and client_

### On Completion
* Create a Zip from the updated source code and send it to your point of contact for review
	* _Please delete the node_modules directory before compressing_

## Development Environment 

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
  * A full fake REST API

## Running the Application

Review the available scripts in the [package.json](package.json)   

## Run in Production Mode

Application will run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Enter any username and password to login

`npm start`

## Run in Development Mode

Application will run on [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Enter any username and password to login

`npm run start-dev`

_Please Note:  To have Angular call `json-server` directly, set `DEBUG` to `true` in [app.service.ts](./src/app/app.service.ts)_
